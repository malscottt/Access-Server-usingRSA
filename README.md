# Access-Server-usingRSA

This project demonstrates a secure access server implementation utilizing the RSA encryption algorithm. RSA is a widely used asymmetric encryption method that employs a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.


**Key Features:**


**Secure Communication:** Ensures encrypted data exchange between client and server.

**Authentication:** Validates user identity using RSA-based key verification.

**Confidentiality:** Protects sensitive information during transmission.

**Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses distinct public and private keys for encryption and decryption.

**How It Works?**


**Key Generation:**

A public-private key pair is generated.
The private key is shared with clients, while the public key is securely stored on the server.


**How Client can Access?:**

The client will using the server's private key to gain access.


**Server Decryption:**

The server will store public key so when it matches with client's private key, the server will allow clients to access the server.


**Secure Access:**
The server validates the client request and grants/denies access based on encrypted credentials.
