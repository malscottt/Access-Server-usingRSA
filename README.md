# Access-Server-usingRSA

Access Server Using RSA
This project demonstrates a secure access server implementation utilizing the RSA encryption algorithm. RSA is a widely used asymmetric encryption method that employs a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Key Features:
Secure Communication: Ensures encrypted data exchange between client and server.
Authentication: Validates user identity using RSA-based key verification.
Confidentiality: Protects sensitive information during transmission.
Asymmetric Encryption: Uses distinct public and private keys for encryption and decryption.
How It Works
Key Generation:
A public-private key pair is generated.
The public key is shared with clients, while the private key is securely stored on the server.
Client Encryption:
The client encrypts sensitive data using the server's public key.
Server Decryption:
The server decrypts the received data using its private key.
Secure Access:
The server validates the client request and grants/denies access based on encrypted credentials.
