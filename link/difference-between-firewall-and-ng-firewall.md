# Difference between Firewall & NG Firewall

**Firewall**

* Traditional Firewall operates at network layer (Layer 3) and transport layer (Layer 4)
* Basic packet filtering based on source/destination IP addresses and ports
* Limited visibility into application layer traffic
* Cannot detect or prevent sophisticated threats

**Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**

* Deep packet inspection at application layer (Layer 7)
* Integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS)
* Advanced threat protection
* SSL/TLS inspection capabilities
* User identity awareness
* Built-in malware protection
* Cloud-based threat intelligence
