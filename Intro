In this project, I will show you how to generate private key and public key AND how to apply it in our server.

Before we start, we need 2 essential tools:

- Rocky Linux ( Can be installed by search in on Google and run it in VMware Workstation )
- PuTTY ( make sure to install the latest version or this project might not work )
